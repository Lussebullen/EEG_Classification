# Few-Shot Classification of EEG with Quasi-Inductive Transfer Learning
BSc Project Lund University 2022.

This project employed inductive transfer learning to classify Time-Frequency transformed EEG data. The pre-trained models used, were trained on a vastly different domain, resulting in less transferrable learned weights. In the end, the project didn't yield notable results.

This branch contains the code used for the Inter-Subject Transfer Learning section, along with the significance testing of these.
